**中英对照演讲稿**  

I don’t know what that dream is that you have, I don't care how disappointing it might have been as you've been working toward that dream, but that dream that you’re holding in your mind, that it’s possible!  

我不管你的梦想是什么，也不管你在追求梦想的途中经历了多少挫折和痛苦，只要你始终坚持自己的梦想，它就有实现的一天！  

Some of you already know, that it’s hard, it’s not easy, it's hard changing your life.That in the process of working on your dreams you're going to incur lots of disappointment, a lot of failure, a lot of pain.  

你们有的知道这很难,你们很难改变自己的生活轨迹.在追求梦想的过程中,你将遭遇数不尽的挫折、失败和痛苦.  

There are moments that you are going to doubt yourself. You said, God why is this happening to me? I’m just trying to take care of my family, trying to give them a good life, I'm not trying to steal or rob from anybody.  

很多时候你甚至会怀疑你自己,你说，老天为什么会让我遇上这种事情? 我只想照顾好我的家人，给他们安定的生活，我本分做人，不偷不抢.  

Why does this have to happen to me. For those of you that have experienced some hardships – don’t give up on your dream.  

老天为什么对我那么不公平。如果你们有人经历过这样的磨难，请不要放弃心中的梦想！  

Most people they raise a family, they earn a living and then they die. They stop growing, they stop working on themselves, they stop stretching, the stop pushing themselves.  

大多数人整日里只为养家糊口而奔忙,庸庸碌碌了此一生.他们放弃了成长和做梦的机会,放弃了施展才华、挑战自我的可能。  

Then a lot of people like to complain but they don’t wanna do anything about their situation. and most people don’t wo-rk on their dreams – why?  

很多人因此而满腹牢骚、怨天尤人，可他们不愿意有所作为、改变现状，大部分人没有实现梦想的斗志，为什么？  

1.Is because of fear,fear of failure“what if things don't work out“?

一：是害怕失败，“如果到头来一场空怎么办？”

2. Is fair of success “what if they do and I can't handle it?”

二：是担忧成功，“如果到时候我做不了呢？”

These are not risk takers.

他们都是看客，不是冒险者！

Everybody won't see it, everybody won't join you, everybody won’t have the vision…it’s necessary to know that you are an uncommon breed.

大家都看不到你的梦想，他们也不会加入你的人生，他们没有这样的视野……你要知道你不是普通的看客.

It’s necessary that you align yourself with people and attract people into your business, who are hungry, people who are unstoppable and unreasonable, people who are refusing to live life just as it is and who want more!

你一定要招引志同道合的人携手同行，你们追求梦想的脚步无可阻挡，你们拒绝满足现状！追求，永不停歇！

The people that are living their dreams are parting with winners, to attach themselves to the a-n-d the people who are living their dreams are the people that know that if it’s going to happen it’s up to them!

勇于追求梦想的人是未来的成功者，他们知道成功与否只在于他们自己。

You don’t have to go through life being a victim. and even though you face disappointments, you have to know within yourself that ‘I can do this, even if no one else sees it for me, I must see it for myself!’

你不需要一辈子被旁人所左右，即便你自己遭遇种种挫折，你要确信，我可以克服，即使没有人看好我，我自己要清醒看到！

I wanna represent an idea. I wanna represent possibilities. Some of you right now, you wanna go to the next level. You wanna be a civil engineer, you wanna council, you wanna be a doctor.

我想实现自己的想法、探索各种可能性，你们在座的有些人想进入更好的层次，有的想当律师，有的想成为土木工程师，有的想当医生。

Listen to me: You can’t get to that level. You can’t get to that level until you start to invest in your mind.

我想说，你进不了那个层次，除非你开始投资你自己。

I dare you to invest in your mind.

投资你自己。

I dare you to invest time.

给自己更多的时间。

I dare you to be alone.

学会与自己相处。

I dare you to spend an HOUR alone to get to know yourself.

每天花一个小时来了解你自己。

After we face a rejection and a “no” or we have a meeting and no one shows up, or somebody says “you can count on me” and they don’t come through, what if we have that kind of attitude that cause reposes, nobody believes in you,

即便我们遭到冷淡的拒绝，演讲没有一个人捧场，你信赖的人没有支持你到最后，即便你得不到任何回应，没有人相信你的能力，

you’ve lost again, and again, the lights are cut off but you are still looking at your dream, reviewing it everyday and saying to yourself: IT’S NOT OVER UNTIL I WIN!

你一次又一次地失败，在黑暗中孤独摸索，你也依然坚持自己的梦想，每天提醒自己并对自己说：“我将奋斗不息，直到成功！”
